## About this challenge

- As a user, when I view the table there are 6 columns with the underlying data structure(example values in parens): 
email(something@somewhere.com), first name(joe), last name(smith jr), primary group(important people), phone number(781-633-2222), hours studied(1000).
- and I am presented with a search box 
- and I want to find an email in the email data structure and a group in the group data structure 
- and I want to determine which users have studied the most and the least.
